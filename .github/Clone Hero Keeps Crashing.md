If Windows Update does not find any updates for your graphics drivers, you can use a third-party driver updater tool that can scan your PC and find the best drivers for your graphics card. There are many such tools available online, but make sure you choose a reliable and reputable one. To use this option, follow these steps:
    1. Download and install a driver updater tool of your choice.
    2. Run the tool and scan your PC for outdated or missing drivers.
    3. Select your graphics card from the list of drivers and click on Update.
    4. Wait for the tool to download and install the latest drivers for your graphics card.
