Another topic covered in chapter 9 is contingencies. Contingencies are uncertain situations that involve a potential gain or loss for a business. Examples of contingencies include lawsuits, warranties, and environmental issues. Contingencies are accounted for differently depending on their likelihood and measurability. If a contingency is probable and can be reasonably estimated, it should be recorded as a liability and an expense. If a contingency is possible but not probable, or if it cannot be reasonably estimated, it should be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. If a contingency is remote, it does not need to be recorded or disclosed.
`  `
A third topic covered in chapter 9 is payroll accounting. Payroll accounting involves recording and reporting the compensation and benefits of employees. Payroll accounting involves calculating gross pay, deductions, and net pay for each employee. Gross pay is the amount of money earned by an employee before any deductions. Deductions are amounts withheld from gross pay for taxes, insurance, retirement plans, and other purposes. Net pay is the amount of money paid to an employee after all deductions. Payroll accounting also involves recording and reporting the employer's payroll taxes and benefits expenses.
