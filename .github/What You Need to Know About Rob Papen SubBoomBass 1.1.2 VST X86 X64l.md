If you are looking for a dedicated bass synth that can produce huge cone-rattling sounds, you might want to check out Rob Papen SubBoomBass 1.1.2 VST X86 X64l. This plugin is based on the Predator engine, which is known for its phat sounding synth and effects. SubBoomBass has been carefully crafted by Rob Papen and other guest artists to provide you with the tools to create fresh new bass lines for any musical style, from Hip Hop and RnB to Dubstep, Drum and Bass, Garage, Grime and more.
 
SubBoomBass features two oscillators with analogue types waveforms and tuned percussion waveforms, which can be modulated by pulse width modulation (PWM), frequency modulation (FM) or ring modulation (RM). Each oscillator also has a sub-oscillator that can produce a square wave or a sinus wave. You can adjust the symmetry, octave, semitone, fine-tuning and keyboard tracking of each oscillator, as well as sync them or run them free.

The plugin also offers a powerful filter section, with two filters that can be used in serial, parallel or split mode. The main filter is an analogue modelled stereo multimode filter, offering 6dB, 12dB, 18dB and 24dB low-pass and high-pass filters, as well as band-pass, notch, comb and vocal filters. The second filter is an additional filter with 6dB, 12dB and 24dB low-pass or high-pass settings. You can control the cutoff frequency of the filters with various modulation sources, such as envelope, velocity, key-tracking, LFO and modulation wheel. You can also add some pre-filtering distortion for extra grit.
 
The amp section of SubBoomBass allows you to shape the volume envelope of your sound with attack, decay, sustain, fade and release parameters. You can also adjust the volume, velocity sensitivity and panning of your sound. The plugin also features a free modulation section, with an envelope that can modulate 48 destinations, such as pitch, filter cutoff, LFO speed and more.
 
SubBoomBass also comes with a groove sequencer and two effects slots that can be modulated by the LFO or the envelope. The effects include distortion, chorus, flanger, phaser, delay, reverb and more. You can also use the easy edit page and the quick browser system to find the sounds you need quickly and easily.
