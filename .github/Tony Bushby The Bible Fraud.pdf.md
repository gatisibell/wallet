# The Bible Fraud: A Controversial Book That Challenges Christian Beliefs
 
The Bible Fraud is a book by Tony Bushby that claims to reveal the untold story of Jesus Christ and his twin brother, Judas Khrestus. The book is based on a mysterious inscription on a German headstone, coded sentences in the Shakespearean plays, ancient British coins, secret ciphers in the New Testament, pictorial cryptograms in Vatican art treasures, curious statues in a church in Southern France, and hidden church records that have been suppressed from the public domain.

The book argues that the New Testament and its story of Jesus Christ were fabricated by the Roman Emperor Constantine and his bishops at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. The book also claims that Jesus and Judas were twin brothers who were born in Britain and married to two sisters who were descendants of King David. The book further alleges that Jesus and Judas were crucified together in Jerusalem, but both survived and escaped to France, where they founded a royal bloodline that still exists today.
 
The Bible Fraud has been criticized by many scholars and theologians as a work of fiction and pseudohistory that lacks any credible evidence or sources. The book has also been accused of plagiarism, distortion, and fabrication of facts. The book has been banned in some countries and denounced by the Vatican as a dangerous attack on the Christian faith.
 
However, the book has also attracted some readers who are interested in alternative views of history and religion. The book has been compared to The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, which also explores the idea of a secret bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. The book has also been linked to the prophecies of Nostradamus, who allegedly predicted the emergence of such a book that would expose the truth about the church of Rome.

The Bible Fraud is not the only book that challenges Christian beliefs. There are many other books that question the historical accuracy and authenticity of the Bible and its teachings. Some of these books include The Jesus Mysteries by Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy, The Jesus Papers by Michael Baigent, The Jesus Dynasty by James Tabor, The Lost Gospel by Simcha Jacobovici and Barrie Wilson, and The Jesus Conspiracy by Holger Kersten and Elmar Gruber.

These books offer different perspectives and interpretations of the life and teachings of Jesus, based on various sources and evidence. Some of these sources include the Gnostic gospels, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi library, the Turin Shroud, and other ancient manuscripts and artifacts. These books claim to reveal the hidden secrets and mysteries of Christianity that have been suppressed or distorted by the church authorities for centuries.
 
However, these books also face similar criticisms and controversies as The Bible Fraud. Many scholars and theologians dismiss these books as sensationalist and speculative works that lack any scholarly rigor or validity. They argue that these books are based on selective and biased use of evidence, misinterpretation and misrepresentation of sources, and conspiracy theories that have no historical or logical basis. They also warn that these books can mislead and confuse the faithful and undermine the foundations of Christian faith.
